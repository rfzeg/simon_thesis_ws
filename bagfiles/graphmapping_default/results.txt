Steps in tuning the KartoSLAM mapper

- First parameter to be tuned is the range_threshold that is ... (NEED DEFINITION HERE): to do so, the filter was started with very low number of particle (min 10, max 50), while the range threshold started at 10

- Range theshold prooved values, 30, 60, 90, 110 while keeping particles number to (10,50)

- We noticed that the results for range_threshold=90 and range_threshold=110 give not difference in results, so choose 90 as tuned parameter.
- Now increase particles gradually till  an optimal
- Choose map for the optimal
